4th Internship Project: Basic Firewall Management & Network Traffic Filtering!

Iâ€™m excited to share that I have successfully completed another milestone in my cybersecurity internship, focused on strengthening network security through practical firewall configuration.

ðŸ“Œ Key Tasks Completed:

Opened and managed the firewall configuration (UFW on Linux)

Listed existing firewall rules for clear visibility

Added rules to block and allow inbound traffic on specific ports (e.g., blocking Telnet port 23 and allowing SSH port 22)

Verified rule effectiveness with tools like Nmap

Practiced removing test rules and restoring original configurations

Documented all commands and steps used

Summarized how firewalls filter and manage network traffic

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway:
Firewalls are the first line of defense for any network â€” controlling which connections are allowed or blocked is essential for minimizing attack surfaces.

Looking forward to learning more advanced techniques and applying them to real-world scenarios!
